1. What is React JS and what problems does it try and solve? Support your answer with concepts introduced in class and from your personal research on the web.

`React JS allows us to create applications with dynamic components that allow data to be passed in, re-rendering only components that change states instead of the entire page which will cause performance issues.`

1. What does it mean to think in react?

`That everything is a component so creating an architectural design of a project is for the best. You sort of break everything down and then it all comes together in the app.js. This way you can build huge applications that are reusable because you can import and export components on the fly. Also you're using html/css/js all in one spot.`

2. Describe state.

`State is a property that belongs to said component, so when the state of the property changes only that component re-renders.`

2. Describe props.

`Properties or props for short are passed to components via HTML attributes. You can pass data from one component to another.`

2. What are side effects, and how do you sync effects in a React component to state or prop changes?

`A side effect is any effect OTHER THAN its return value. It's harder to reuse functions that have side effects because they end up not doing that 1 thing they do best.`
